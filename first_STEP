What we need:
1. A mobile phone with root privileges
2. Android development environment
3. A team member

To decrypt WeChat messages : 

1. Get WeChat chat history
WeChat chat history is saved in"/data/data/com.tencent.mm/MicroMsg/c5fb89d4729f72c345711cb*/EnMicroMsg.db"

This file is an encrypted database file that needs to be opened with sqlcipher.
The password is: the first seven digits of MD5 (IMEI + WeChat UIN)

MD5 ('mm' + WeChat UIN).

In the first step, it is not possible to go directly to EnMicroMsg.db. No permissions, but also to avoid conflict with WeChat itself, 
so choose to copy this file to your own project:


oldPath ="/data/data/com.tencent.mm/MicroMsg/c5fb89d4729f72c345711cb**\***/EnMicroMsg.db";
 newPath="/data/data/com.your project/EnMicroMsg.db";
 copyFile (oldPath, newPath);
